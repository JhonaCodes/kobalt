# Kobalt 🎨

> **Experimental Project** 🧪
> Just a hobby project to learn WGPU and explore UI framework development!

Hey there! This is my personal experiment building a cross-platform UI framework using **WGPU**. It's mainly for learning, having fun, and seeing what's possible. Don't expect production-ready code here... yet? Maybe never? Who knows! 😄

## What is this?

Kobalt is a **mobile-first UI framework** designed for mobile developers who want to use Rust. Think Jetpack Compose or Flutter, but powered by Rust and WGPU.

The goal is to make it **mobile developer friendly** by using familiar patterns and concepts:
- 🎯 **Declarative UI** (like Compose/SwiftUI)
- 🔄 **Modern state management** (LiveData, MVVM, reactive patterns)
- 📱 **Mobile-first approach** with desktop and web as bonuses
- ⚡ **Native performance** through WGPU

### Target Platforms
- **Mobile**: iOS, Android (the main focus!)
- **Desktop**: Windows, macOS, Linux
- **Web**: WebAssembly

## Why?

I've been developing mobile applications for several years, and I've been using Rust for about a year now. I'm convinced that Rust could bring a lot to cross-platform development, especially for mobile. So I thought, why not try to create a UI framework? It could be a good starting point, or in the best case scenario, make it into something truly usable.

**Why doesn't anyone think about us?** 😭 Mobile developers who love Rust and want familiar patterns like Compose or Flutter, but with all the benefits of Rust. We exist! There are dozens of us! DOZENS!

**If you dream of seeing Rust powering mobile UIs, welcome!** This is going to be fun... and painful. Probably more painful than fun at first, but hey, that's part of the journey! 😅

Let's see where this experiment takes us.

## Current Status

Very early stages. Mostly just setting up the project structure and learning as I go. This is more of a learning journal than a production framework.

## Goals (Maybe?)

### Core Framework
- [ ] Declarative UI API (Compose/SwiftUI-like syntax)
- [ ] Reactive state management (LiveData-inspired)
- [ ] MVVM architecture support
- [ ] Layout system (Flexbox/Column/Row)
- [ ] Common widgets (Button, Text, Image, List, etc.)
- [ ] Touch/gesture handling

### Mobile-Specific
- [ ] Native iOS integration
- [ ] Native Android integration
- [ ] Platform-specific components
- [ ] Navigation patterns familiar to mobile devs
- [ ] Hot reload (the dream!)

### Nice to Have
- [ ] Desktop and web support
- [ ] Theming system
- [ ] Animation API
- [ ] Document everything for mobile developers coming from Compose/Flutter

## Can I use this?

You can look at it, learn from it, or laugh at my code! But seriously, this is super experimental and changes constantly. Not recommended for anything serious.
